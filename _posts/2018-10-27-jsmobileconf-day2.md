	- Focusing
	- Guest permission

	- Debugger Attach: share port required
	- Sharing port: any process expose TCP port, database!
	- Share files, share entire environment
	- Share terminal

## Building Progressive Web Apps
- What is PWA?
	- Reliable : offline
	- Fast: cache
	- Engaging: push notifications, installation, pretty theme
	
- PWA metric
	- respond 200 when off-line
	- prompted to install
	- register a server worker
	- fallback when JS isn’t available
	- custom splash screen 

- Being Reliable
	- Caching; for offline
	- Fallback; when no javascript enabled

```
$ ng add @angular/pwa
```

Select `Progressive Web App` support when generating a project using angular/react CLI

- Being Fast
	- Server side rendering
	- lazy loading
- Being Engaging

	- link manifest.json file

## Everything You Need To Node
- The Usual Suspects: microservices, backend
- The Unusual suspects: realtime apps, game, machine learning, universal rendering, file reading/parsing, IoT
- Non-blocking, event-driven single thread architecture
- ‘push technology’ for web socket

- WebSocket: for collaboration

	- User testing
	- Behaviour
	
## How to Write Great Docs as a Bad Writer
[chrisvfritz (Chris Fritz) / Repositories · GitHub](https://github.com/chrisvfritz?tab=repositories)

- Why write docs?
	- A feature doesn’t exist until it’s documented.
	- Documentation Driven Development
	- Writing docs is personally useful
	- Permission to ask questions (ask what is not in documentation)

- What’s the goal of documentation?
	- Manage emotions: readers should feel smart, powerful, curious
	- Do not bore, frustrate, confuse reader -> they stop reading

- **Personas** (character profile)
	- Who are you serving? (Who are the docs actually for?)
	- How are they using your docs?
	- What are they looking for?
	
- Very specific stories
	- Are they being interrupted?
	- Are they have enough time?

- Organizing docs
	- Intros (5 minutes)
	- References: API listing, Examples/cookbook
	- Expert guides: In-depth topics, Style guide
	- Overlap is normal

- Trade-offs
	- simple..thorough
	- beginners..experts

- What to write first?
	- Maximize `power` / `effort`
	
- Don’t start with the solution/feature, **Start with the problem**
	- (X) Using props
	- (O) Passing data to child components with props

- Avoid humor
- Respect other people’s time

- Reviewers can’t make docs good unless the doc is already good
- Avoid obsessive perfectionism

> Is everything OK?  
> *Listen -> Mirror -> Validate -> Negotiate*
