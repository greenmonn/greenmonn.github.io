deep copy와 shallow copy가 헷갈릴 때

<!--more-->

When creating copies of arrays or objects one can make a deep copy or a shallow copy.

## Shallow Copy

In case of shallow copy, a reference of object is copied in other object. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do reflect in the original object.

### Shallow Copy Example in Go

```golang
original = &MyObject{"hello"}
copied = new(MyObject)

*copied = *original
```

## Deep Copy

In case of deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object.


> The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for **compound objects** (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances).
A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, **recursively**, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.
