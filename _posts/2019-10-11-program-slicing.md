    - Debugging
    - Maintenance
    - Re-engineering
    - Re-escape
    - Comprehension
    - Refactoring


## Static Slicing
    * considers all possible executions
    * for all possible inputs

## Dynamic Slicing
    * considers specific executions
    * for a specific input, and only preserves the behaviour for that input
